1
00:00:01,365 --> 00:00:02,854
The news never ends.

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:04,444
This is tenneti GCR,

3
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:07,390
you get all the news
you need, all day long.

4
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:13,290
Good morning. It's 42° and
10:30 on this Thursday October 15.

5
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:15,584
I'm Standale Brodston.
Here's what's happening.

6
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:18,076
It's day eighteen of
the garbage stall,

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,815
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day,

8
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:23,899
even the nicest sections of the
city are looking like swamps.

9
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:27,870
Health commissioner Edward O'Roark is
declaring a citywide state of emergency

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,592
for the first time in decades.

11
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:33,581
There's no need to wait until somebody
dies or comes down with typhoid fever.

12
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:35,723
It's already a serious situation.

13
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,133
It's something that affects
almost everyone in the city,

14
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:40,367
no matter who they are
or where they live.

15
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:44,709
You can't go down no one avenue without
seeing nothing but garbage and rats.

16
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:48,916
It's starting to affect my business when customers
can't get in here because of garbage situation.

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,942
When out there, not just smell it,

18
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,862
but I think to look at it,
its terrible.

19
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:57,241
It don't affect me, except for the
the very bad smell, it's horrific.

20
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:58,353
The mess.

21
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:01,954
I've been in this country for 50 years
and I've never seen anything like it.

22
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:03,636
What is this world coming to?

23
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:06,149
Put them in the room there and
sit there and talk 'till they got it over with.

24
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,721
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

25
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:12,329
The Idea of the National Guard pulling
in and cleaning up, it's good idea!

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,463
In other news the Building
Industry of Landlords today

27
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:18,680
expressed concern over the latest
increase in heating oil prices.

28
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,393
Rangers in the Metro area are
searched to fill them in...

29
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:56,458
Let's get it.

30
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,833
- Yo, what's up with your shoes, bro?
- Nice outfit, huh?

31
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:02,460
If you're gonna be a clown, at least you
can be a bill-boy, you know that, right?

32
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:05,150
- Hey!
- Stop it!

33
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,659
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hey!

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,601
- Come on, Kyle, let's go!
- We've got the sign!

35
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:13,044
Let's go!

36
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,811
- Stop there!
- Come on!

37
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,502
Watch your go!
Watch your go!

38
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:19,975
Make me stop, clown.

39
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:21,737
Hey!

40
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,324
C'mon clown, you are not
catching up.

41
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:29,058
Stop them!

42
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:29,821
Come on!

43
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,076
- Come on!
- Get out of the way!

44
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,364
Stop them!

45
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:40,940
Hey!

46
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,074
You bastards.

47
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:52,496
Come on, beat his ass up.

48
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,452
Come on, this guy's weak,
can't do nothing.

49
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,272
Harder! Harder!

50
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:58,011
Beat him up.
Take his stuff.

51
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,424
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, come on, come on!

52
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:00,434
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

53
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:46,272
Is it just me,

54
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:49,117
or is it getting crazier out there?

55
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:54,964
It is certainly tense.

56
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,008
People are upset.

57
00:04:58,783 --> 00:04:59,792
They're struggling.

58
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:01,074
Looking for work.

59
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:04,053
These are tough times.

60
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,259
How 'bout you?

61
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,911
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

62
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,839
Yes, Ma'am.

63
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,209
Great.

64
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,556
Did you bring it with you?

65
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,398
Arthur...

66
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:28,117
last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you

67
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:29,838
for these appointments.

68
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:31,463
Can I see it?

69
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:47,033
I've been using it as a--
as a journal,

70
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,443
but also as a joke diary.

71
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,607
Funny thoughts or
observations.

72
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:59,127
I think I told you I'm pursuing
a career in stand-up comedy.

73
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:04,671
No, you didn't.

74
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,828
I think I did.

75
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,966
"I just hope my death makes
more cents than my life."

76
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:39,523
How does it feel to
have to come here?

77
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:41,340
Does it help

78
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:42,958
to have someone to talk to?

79
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,959
I think I felt better when
I was locked up in a hospital.

80
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,105
And having thought more about

81
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,492
why you were locked up?

82
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,395
Who knows?

83
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,326
I was wondering if you could ask the
doctor to increase my medication?

84
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,818
Arthur, you're on seven
different medications.

85
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,067
Surely, they must
be doing something.

86
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:31,492
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

87
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,671
Can you please stop
bothering my kid?

88
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:15,278
- Sit!
- I wasn't bothering him...

89
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,806
- Just stop!
- I was...

90
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,078
What, you think that's funny?

91
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,417
I'm sorry, I have a co...

92
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:47,030
"It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent and
uncontrollable laughter that doesn’t match

93
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:50,628
how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain
injury or certain neurological conditions."

94
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,157
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:36,651
Happy? Did you check the mail
before you came up?

96
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,058
Yeah, mom.

97
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,932
Nothing.

98
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:47,464
And finally tonight, just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse.

99
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:51,194
Authorities are saying the city is
under siege by scores of rats.

100
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:54,735
- And not just any rats - super rats.
- More hard to kill.

101
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,893
He must not be
getting any of my letters.

102
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,228
It's Thomas Wayne, mom.

103
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,250
- He is a busy man.
- Oh, please.

104
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,448
I worked for that
family for years.

105
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,630
The least he could do
is write back.

106
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:12,322
Here, all worked up.
Eat.

107
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,768
- You need to eat.
- You need to eat.

108
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,507
How skinny you are.

109
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,310
He will make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

110
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:29,207
Oh, yeah?
Everybody who?

111
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,780
- Who do you talk to?
- Well, everybody on the news.

112
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:35,322
He is the only one who
could save the city.

113
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,363
He owes it to us.

114
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:41,765
Come, sit. It's starting.

115
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,705
Oh, my!

116
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,844
From NCB studios
in Gotham city!

117
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,879
It's Live with Murray Franklin!

118
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,634
Tonight Murray welcomes,
Sandra Winger,

119
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:59,944
comedian Skip Byron and the
piano styling of Yeldon & Chantel!

120
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:02,459
Joining Murray as always,

121
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:04,894
Ellis Drane and
his Jazz Orchestra.

122
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:07,822
And now, without further ado,

123
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:11,162
Murray Franklin!

124
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,375
Thank you.

125
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,672
Thank you.

126
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:29,978
We've got a great
looking audience today.

127
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:32,076
- Yeah!
- Murray!

128
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,103
Wow.
Thank you. Thank you.

129
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:35,172
Thank you.

130
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:39,849
So, everybody's heard about the super
rats stutter in Gotham now, right?

131
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,363
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

132
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:45,991
You ready for this?

133
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,630
Super cats.

134
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,547
- But no, serious it is, I mean these guys are...
- I love you, Murray!

135
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:57,856
I love you, too.

136
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,723
Hey, Bobby, will you
put the lights on?

137
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:03,981
Who is that?
Was that you?

138
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,397
You wanna stand up, please?

139
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,186
Stand. Stand up for me.

140
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:08,950
There.

141
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:15,035
What's your name?

142
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,022
Hi, Murray.
Arthur.

143
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,598
- Arthur?
- My name is Arthur.

144
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:22,532
Ah, okay, well, there is something
special about you, Arthur. I could tell.

145
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:25,329
- Where are you from?
- I live right here in the city.

146
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:26,977
With my m--mother.

147
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:31,109
Okay, hold on. Hold on.
There is nothing funny about that.

148
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:33,807
I lived with my mother
before I made it. Just me and her.

149
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:36,520
I'm that kid who's father went
out for a pack of cigarettes.

150
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,371
And he never came back.

151
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:40,920
I know what that's like, Murray.

152
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:43,762
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

153
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,663
I take good care of my mother.

154
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:53,379
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

155
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,592
She does.

156
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:58,595
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

157
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:01,627
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

158
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:07,099
Wow!

159
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:12,524
I like that. I like that a lot!
Come on down.

160
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,687
Come on! For that,
you've got to come down.

161
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,943
Come on!
Come on!

162
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:25,835
Come on!

163
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,271
Okay, we've got
a big show tonight.

164
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:44,400
Stay tuned.
We will be right back.

165
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,174
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

166
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,911
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say, it made my day.

167
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:51,574
Thanks, Murray.

168
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:55,002
You see all this, the lights, the show,
the audience, all that stuff?

169
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,646
I'd give it all up in a heartbeat
to have a kid like you.

170
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:40,573
You're such a jerk.

171
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:43,031
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

172
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,339
Another day in chuckle town.

173
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:50,689
You okay?

174
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,357
I heard about the
beat-down you took.

175
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,717
Fucking savages.

176
00:15:57,865 --> 00:16:00,931
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should've left them alone.

177
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,573
No, they'll take everything
from here if you do that.

178
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,866
All the crazy shit out there?
They're animals.

179
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,361
You know what?

180
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,674
Here.

181
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:22,200
What is it?

182
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:23,905
Take it.

183
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,829
It's for you.

184
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:32,151
You gotta protect yourself out there,

185
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:34,517
otherwise you're
gonna get fucked.

186
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:37,496
Randall.

187
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,256
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

188
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:46,238
Don't sweat it, Art.
No one has to know.

189
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:48,785
And you can pay me
back some other time.

190
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,459
You know you're my boy.

191
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,016
Arthur... Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

192
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,588
Hey, Gary, you know what
I've always wondered?

193
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,726
No idea.

194
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:03,472
Do you people call it miniature golf,
or is it just golf to you?

195
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,371
Punch him in the dick, Gary.

196
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,433
Hello, Hoyt.

197
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,154
Gary said you wanted to see me?

198
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:35,454
How's the comedy career?
You're a famous stand-up yet?

199
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:36,745
Not quite.

200
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,731
Just been working on
my material.

201
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,756
No, don't sit.
This will be quick.

202
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:43,314
Look.
I like you, Arthur.

203
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:46,029
You know, lot of the guys here
think you're a freak, but I like you.

204
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:48,395
I don't even know
why I like you.

205
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:50,453
But I got another complaint.

206
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,070
And it's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

207
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,153
The guy said you disappeared.

208
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,169
Never even returned his sign.

209
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,526
Because I got jumped.

210
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,187
Didn't you hear?

211
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:03,950
For a sign?

212
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,641
It's bullshit.
It doesn't make sense,

213
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:08,616
just give him his sign back.

214
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:11,198
He's going out of business
for God's sake, Arthur.

215
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,246
Why would
I keep that sign?

216
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:15,910
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

217
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,146
If you don't return the sign,

218
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:21,569
I got to take it out
of your pay check.

219
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,058
Are we clear?

220
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:28,517
Listen, I'm trying to help you. Okay?

221
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,012
Now I tell you something else.

222
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:33,193
The other guys, they don't feel
comfortable around you, Arthur.

223
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:35,760
Because people think
you're weird, okay?

224
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:38,039
And I can't have that around me.

225
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:40,066
I want it-- I want it to work out---

226
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:31,778
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait!

227
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,628
Thank you.

228
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,459
This building is
so awful, isn't it?

229
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,099
This building is so awful,
right, mommy?

230
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:06,525
Yeah, sweetie.
I hear you, GiGi.

231
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,270
It's so awful, mommy.

232
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:12,485
Right, mommy?

233
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:20,761
- It's fine.
- This building's so awful, isn't it?

234
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:28,605
Hey.

235
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,909
Come on.

236
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:57,665
Head up.

237
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:00,322
Maybe the mailman
is throwing them away.

238
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:03,429
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

239
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,627
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- He's gonna help us.

240
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,563
You worked
for them, what?

241
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:11,877
30 years ago?

242
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,463
Why would he help us?

243
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,329
Because Thomas
Wayne is a good man.

244
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,513
If he knew how we were living,

245
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:22,984
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

246
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:26,743
I can't explain it to
you any better than that.

247
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,209
I don't want you
worrying about money.

248
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,510
Or me.

249
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,654
Everybody’s telling me that my
stand-up is ready for the big clubs.

250
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,579
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

251
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:43,710
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

252
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,794
don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

253
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:53,310
Hey, what's your name?

254
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:55,094
Arthur.

255
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:56,872
Hey, Arthur.

256
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,936
You're a really good dancer.

257
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,239
I know.

258
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:02,756
And who is not?

259
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,252
Him.

260
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:11,212
Happy! What was that?
Are you okay?

261
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:12,536
Mom, what?

262
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:14,644
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

263
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,090
I'm-- I'm watching
an old war movie!

264
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:18,867
Turn it down!

265
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,740
It's hard, mom.

266
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:50,642
It's nice to see these
couples are at my show.

267
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,838
I have a wife,
we love to role play.

268
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:56,491
Yes. Yes, very sexy.

269
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,441
My favorite one right now is...

270
00:24:58,535 --> 00:25:02,789
professor and senior who really
needs to pass my class to graduate.

271
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:05,077
Yes.

272
00:25:06,811 --> 00:25:08,127
So I tell you how I operate.

273
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:10,834
I'm a professor at a prestigious
New England university.

274
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:16,184
And my wife is a senior in
my intro to western civ.

275
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:21,674
I know, I know, why is she--
why is she a senior in intro?

276
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,426
I didn't buy it either.

277
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,392
So she comes to me
during my office hours,

278
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,306
Monday and Wednesday
3:00 to 5:00,

279
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:30,200
and she says, - excuse me,
professor Lewis.

280
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,130
I can't use my real last name at this
collage 'cause they don't hire Jews.

281
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:39,273
Something I'll address once
I have a tenure, but for now.

282
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,248
She says, - excuse me professor Lewis.

283
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,867
I think I might be in danger
of failing intro to western civ.

284
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:47,523
and I just want you to know I'm
willing to do anything to pass.

285
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:51,872
I said "anything?",
and she says "Aah".

286
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,068
Oh. Hey.

287
00:27:00,214 --> 00:27:01,222
Hey.

288
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:03,427
Were you following me today?

289
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,076
Yeah.

290
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,782
I thought that was you.

291
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:15,298
I was hoping you'd come
in and rob the place.

292
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,677
I have a gun.

293
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,264
I'll come by tomorrow.

294
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:25,206
You're so funny, Arthur.

295
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:29,126
Yeah...

296
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:31,606
You know, I--I do
stand-up comedy.

297
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:34,334
You should maybe come
and see a show sometime.

298
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,079
I could do that.

299
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:37,652
Yeah?

300
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,651
Yeah.
You let me know when?

301
00:27:39,672 --> 00:27:40,681
Yeah.

Arthur, I need to know why you
brought a gun into a kids hospital.

316
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:49,512
It's a part.
It's part of my act now.

to buy a .38 off him last week.

- Randall told you that?
- You 're fuck up, Arthur.

321
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,330
And a liar.

322
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,896
You're fired!

323
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:39,768
I'm telling you, she wanted my number.
We should have just stayed.

324
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:42,591
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested... at all.

325
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:45,138
Are you nuts? Did you see
how close we were dancing!?

326
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:46,005
She was in love, bro.

327
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,809
She couldn't wait

347
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:36,772
♪ There ought to be clowns. ♪

348
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,176
So, buddy, tell us.
What's so fucking funny?

349
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,738
Nothing. I---

350
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:57,411
I have a---
I have a condition.

351
00:31:57,506 --> 00:31:59,794
I'll tell you what you have,
asshole.

352
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:09,913
We've got a kicker, huh? Hey,
hold him steady, hold him steady.

353
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,143
Stay down, freak!

354
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:31,670
No! No!

355
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,502
Hey! Help! Help!

356
00:32:58,358 --> 00:33:00,217
Hey!

357
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,762
Stay clear of the closing doors.

358
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:43,593
I read it was a guy
in a full make-up.

359
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:46,337
No, it says right here
it was a mask.

360
00:36:46,347 --> 00:36:48,536
Either way, I think
it's good for business.

361
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:50,631
They got clowns in front
of every newspaper.

362
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,565
- Big man, what's the good word?
- Hey.

363
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,022
Hey, Arthur.
I heard what happened.

364
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:00,273
Sorry, mate.

365
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:03,326
Yeah, it doesn't seem fair,

366
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,442
you get fired like that.

367
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:08,945
Did you really bring a gun to
the children's hospital, Arty?

368
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:11,552
What the fuck would
you do that for?

369
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,224
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

370
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:15,772
If your dancing doesn't do the trick,
you just gonna shoot yourself?

371
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,404
Why don't you ask
Randall about it?

372
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:21,146
It was his gun.

373
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:24,219
- What?
- I still owe you for that, don't I?

374
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,233
What the fuck are
you talking about?

375
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,924
Stop talking outta
your ass, Art!

376
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:35,248
Oh, no!

377
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:38,045
I forgot to punch out.

378
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,933
And as our city tries
to make sense of the brutal

379
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:14,090
triple murder on the subway last week.

380
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:15,951
We're joined by Thomas Wayne.

381
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:18,475
- Happy, look. Thomas Wayne's on TV.
- He has a personnel connection

382
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,946
- Yes, mother.
- this tragedy.

383
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:21,010
Thanks for having me on show.

384
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:23,860
They're asking him about
those horrible subway murders.

385
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:27,408
Thank you, Thomas. I know
this is a difficult time for you.

386
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:28,794
- Why him?
- These young men all were...

387
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,107
Looks like his compaign.

388
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:33,552
Yes, all three of them
worked for Wayne investments.

389
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:35,463
Good, decent, educated,

390
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:38,575
although, I didn't know
any of them personally.

391
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:43,767
Like all the Wayne employees,
past and present, they were family.

392
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,519
You hear that! I told you.
We're family.

393
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:49,672
There now seems to be a a groundswell
of anti-rich sentiment in the city.

394
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:54,016
It's almost as if our less fortunate
residents are taken the side of the killer.

395
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:55,440
Yes and it's a shame.

396
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:58,521
It's one of the reasons why
I'm considering a run for mayor.

397
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,883
Gotham has lost its way.

398
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:05,685
What about the eyewitness report of
the suspect being a man in a clown mask?

399
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,146
Well, it makes total sense to me.

400
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,227
What kind of a coward would do
something that cold-blooded ?

401
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:13,081
Someone who hides
behind a mask.

402
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,023
Someone who is envious of those
more fortunate than themselves,

403
00:39:19,048 --> 00:39:21,597
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

404
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:24,474
And until all those kind of
people change for the better..

405
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:28,837
those of us who've made
something of our lives,

406
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:30,464
will always look at
those who haven't

407
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,909
as nothing but clowns.

408
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:37,731
Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.

409
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:39,150
It's not funny.

410
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:03,120
I heard this song on the
radio the other day.

411
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:07,307
And the guy was singing,

412
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,965
that his name was Carnival.

413
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:13,343
- Arthur.
- It's just crazy,

414
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,287
because that's my
clown name. At work.

415
00:40:19,842 --> 00:40:21,854
But until a while ago

416
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:25,787
it was like nobody
ever saw me.

417
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:30,243
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

418
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:32,782
Arthur, I have some
bad news for you.

419
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:38,137
You don't listen, do you?

420
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,371
I don't think you ever

421
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:43,764
really hear me.

422
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,507
You just ask the same
questions every week:

423
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:49,056
"How was your job?"

424
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:50,929
"Are you having any
negative thoughts?"

425
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:55,164
All I have are negative thoughts.

426
00:40:55,946 --> 00:40:58,198
But you don't listen. Anyway,

427
00:40:58,996 --> 00:41:00,004
I said,

428
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:02,063
for my whole life

429
00:41:02,562 --> 00:41:05,552
I didn't know if I
even really existed.

430
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,637
But I do.

431
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,556
And people are
starting to notice.

432
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,543
They've cut our funding.

433
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,488
We're closing down
our offices next week.

434
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:24,610
The city's cut funding across the board,
social services is part of that.

435
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:26,993
This is the last time
we will be meeting.

436
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,121
Okay.

437
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:35,696
They don't give a shit about
people like you, Arthur.

438
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:40,694
And they really don't give a shit
about people like me, either.

439
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:45,568
Oh, fuck.

440
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:56,300
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

441
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:01,147
Who do I talk to?

442
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,702
I'm sorry, Arthur.

443
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:11,718
I think, uh-- I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

444
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:15,093
You know, like, "can I see
myself in this long term?"

445
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:18,235
Is it safe. Is it reliable?

446
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,005
Could it kill me?

447
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,628
Most guys look at sex like parking a car.
We're like "there's a spot".

448
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:28,283
"There is another spot,
that would work."

449
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:30,948
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

450
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:35,351
"Handicapped?
Hope no one sees us."

451
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:40,635
Alright that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.

452
00:42:44,914 --> 00:42:47,627
One more time, ya' all.

453
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:52,955
Alright, this next comic describes
himself as a lifelong Gotham resident

454
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,582
who from a young age
was always told that:

455
00:42:55,607 --> 00:43:00,151
"his purpose in life was to bring laughter
and joy into this cold, dark world."

456
00:43:01,085 --> 00:43:02,177
Umm.. okay.

457
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:05,998
Please help me welcome
Arthur Fleck, ya' all. Arthur Fleck.

458
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:32,738
Hello, it's good to be here---

459
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:45,915
I hate--

460
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:59,099
I---I hated

461
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,145
school as a kid.

462
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,830
I hated school as a--
as a kid.

463
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:23,950
But my mother
would always say, -

464
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:28,199
"you should enjoy it.
One day you'll have to work for a living."

465
00:44:29,153 --> 00:44:32,618
"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"

466
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:46,234
Here is one.

467
00:44:47,444 --> 00:44:50,799
You know, I was just
thinking the other day,

468
00:44:51,073 --> 00:44:53,517
why are the rich people so---

469
00:45:33,082 --> 00:45:34,900
Do you believe that shit?

470
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:37,385
Fuck 'em!

471
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:41,928
I think the guy that
did it is a hero.

472
00:45:44,022 --> 00:45:48,480
Three less pricks in Gotham city,
only a million more to go.

473
00:46:17,884 --> 00:46:19,593
I know what you're gonna be thinking.

474
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:22,663
And buddy, as always
thanks for the laughs.

475
00:46:22,673 --> 00:46:25,426
Sure, will see you again.
You will be here, right? I hope.

476
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:29,652
Tomorrow night,
we have Diana Hudson,

477
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,642
Grieg Gordon, and animal
expert Hugh Little.

478
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:35,815
Thanks for watching.

479
00:46:35,892 --> 00:46:37,955
Good night. And always remember

480
00:46:38,222 --> 00:46:39,708
"That's Life".

481
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:45,455
That's life.

482
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:53,292
Mom, time to wake up.
We go to bed.

483
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:58,532
No, Happy.

484
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,988
I wrote him a new letter.

485
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,004
Come on, dance with me.

486
00:47:05,633 --> 00:47:08,260
For Thomas Wayne.
That's important.

487
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:18,874
You smell like cologne.

488
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:21,378
Because I just had a big date.

489
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:28,512
Just don't forget to mail it.

490
00:49:01,394 --> 00:49:04,145
You're gonna kill me!
You're gonna give me a hard time!

491
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,959
- I won't give you a---
- No! No!

492
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:10,522
I'm not talking to you until
you stop being angry!

493
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:11,907
Okay.

494
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:13,176
Okay.

495
00:49:17,656 --> 00:49:19,251
I'm not angry, mom.

496
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:21,577
I'm not angry.

497
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,499
Please.

498
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,902
Mom, is this real?

499
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:33,846
He is an extraordinary man, Happy.

500
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,610
He is a very powerful man.

501
00:49:38,628 --> 00:49:39,810
We were in love.

502
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:45,252
He said it was best if we would not be
together because of appearances.

503
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:51,666
And I couldn’t tell
anyone because,

504
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,647
well,

505
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,032
I signed some papers.

506
00:49:56,942 --> 00:50:00,648
And besides, you can imagine
what people would say about

507
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:02,687
Thomas and me and...

508
00:50:04,636 --> 00:50:06,467
what they’d say about you.

509
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:12,387
What would they say, mom?

510
00:52:45,656 --> 00:52:46,847
Hi.

511
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:51,548
What's your name?

512
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:54,061
I'm Bruce.

513
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:56,350
Bruce.

514
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,373
I'm Arthur.

515
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,026
That's better.

516
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:26,605
Bruce! Bruce!

517
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:30,130
- Get away from that man.
- It's okay. I'm a good guy.

518
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:31,914
What are you doing?
Who are you?

519
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,661
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

520
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:36,394
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

521
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:40,781
- Where did you get him these flowers?
- No, they're not real.

522
00:53:42,229 --> 00:53:43,900
It's...magic.

523
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:47,896
- I was just trying to make him smile.
- Well, It's not funny, is it?

524
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:50,470
Do I need to call the police?

525
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,982
No, please.

526
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,892
My mother's name is Penny.

527
00:53:55,078 --> 00:53:56,435
Penny Fleck.

528
00:53:56,808 --> 00:53:58,154
She used to work here years ago.

529
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:00,101
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

530
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:02,989
You're her son?

531
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,690
Yeah.

532
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,239
Did you know her?

533
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:11,870
I know about the two of them.

534
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,549
She told me everything.

535
00:54:17,274 --> 00:54:18,904
There's nothing to know.

536
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,960
There is no "them".

537
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:24,387
Your mother was delusional.

538
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,855
- She was a sick woman.
- Don't

539
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:29,032
say that.

540
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:32,201
Just go.

541
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:35,208
Before you make
a fool of yourself.

542
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:40,030
- Thomas Wayne is my farther.

543
00:54:44,544 --> 00:54:46,131
He left me!

544
00:54:48,479 --> 00:54:49,994
Let go!

545
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,213
Keep your respiration’s around 15.

546
00:55:18,238 --> 00:55:20,613
Slow, there're some stairs
coming up.

547
00:55:20,638 --> 00:55:22,461
Mom?

548
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,141
- What happened?
- Who are you?

549
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:26,892
- I'm her son.
- Oh, great.

550
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:28,738
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out to decide.

551
00:55:28,763 --> 00:55:31,149
- We don't know what happened yet.
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.

552
00:55:31,474 --> 00:55:33,326
Come on. We have
one more left.

553
00:55:33,493 --> 00:55:35,770
I'm getting a little resistence
here. Come on, give her a lift.

554
00:55:36,725 --> 00:55:37,925
Position her head.

555
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:39,620
Lift.

556
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:47,107
Excuse me, sir.

557
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:49,790
- Does your mother take any medications?
- No.

558
00:55:49,815 --> 00:55:51,183
- Excuse me, I can't hear you.
- No.

559
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,662
- Sir, what was the last time
you spoke to her? - I don't know.

560
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:39,906
Mr. Fleck.

561
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:43,183
Sorry to bother you.
I'm detective Garrity.

562
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,251
This is my partner
detective Burke.

563
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,473
We had a few questions for you,
but you weren’t home.

564
00:56:48,668 --> 00:56:51,556
So... we spoke with
your mother.

565
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:54,331
Oh.

566
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:57,064
What did you say to her?

567
00:56:57,091 --> 00:56:58,764
- Did you do this?
- What?

568
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:59,312
No.

569
00:56:59,322 --> 00:57:01,561
No, no. No, we just
asked her some questions.

570
00:57:02,025 --> 00:57:03,448
And she got hysterical..

571
00:57:03,699 --> 00:57:05,170
hyperventilating,

572
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:06,854
then collapsed and hit her
head pretty hard.

573
00:57:06,878 --> 00:57:09,209
Yeah, the doctor said
she had a stroke.

574
00:57:09,544 --> 00:57:11,076
We're sorry to hear about that.

575
00:57:12,149 --> 00:57:14,820
But like I said, I still has
some questions for you.

576
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:17,683
They're about the subway killings
that happened last week.

577
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,922
- You've heard about them, right?
- Yeah.

578
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:22,551
- It's horrible.
- Right.

579
00:57:23,747 --> 00:57:26,906
So with spoke with your
boss over at...Ha-Ha's.

580
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:30,700
He said you were fired for bringing
a gun into the children's hospital.

581
00:57:32,184 --> 00:57:33,799
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

582
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:35,638
It was part of my act.

583
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:37,680
I'm a party clown.

584
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,850
Alright, so why were you fired?

585
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:45,269
They said I wasn't funny enough.

586
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,819
Can you imagine that?

587
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:48,700
If you don't mind,

588
00:57:49,956 --> 00:57:51,794
I have to go and take
care of my mother.

589
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:55,165
Your boss also gave us
one of your cards.

590
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:59,256
This condition of yours, laughing.

591
00:58:00,091 --> 00:58:02,851
Is it real, or some
sort of a clown thing?

592
00:58:03,723 --> 00:58:06,225
- "A clown thing?"
- Yeah.

593
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,892
I mean, part of your act?

594
00:58:11,236 --> 00:58:12,445
What do you think?

595
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:20,399
It's exit only.

596
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:45,922
She's gonna be okay.

597
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,350
I'll get a coffee.

598
00:58:52,644 --> 00:58:54,416
- You want one?
- Yeah.

599
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:11,403
So, the other night I told
my youngest son, Billy,

600
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:14,031
you know, the new one, the--
not so bright one,

601
00:59:14,812 --> 00:59:17,827
I-- I told him the garbage
strike is still going on, Billy,..

602
00:59:17,852 --> 00:59:19,838
and he says, and
I'm not kidding, Billy says,

603
00:59:19,863 --> 00:59:22,098
"So where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?".

604
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:30,307
And finally,

605
00:59:30,645 --> 00:59:33,154
in a world where everyone
thinks they could do my job,

606
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:36,635
we got this video tape from Pogo's
comedy club right here in Gotham.

607
00:59:36,776 --> 00:59:40,763
Here's a guy who thinks if you just keep
laughing, it'll somehow make you funny.

608
00:59:41,288 --> 00:59:42,546
Check out this joker.

609
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:48,325
Oh, no!

610
00:59:48,404 --> 00:59:51,986
I hated school as a kid.

611
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,167
But my mother would always say,

612
00:59:56,066 --> 00:59:59,922
"You know, you should enjoy it.
One day you'll have to work for a living."

613
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:04,512
"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"

614
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:13,915
You should have
listened to your mother.

615
01:00:14,593 --> 01:00:16,353
And one more.
One more, Bobby.

616
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:19,111
Uh...let's see one more.
I love this guy.

617
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,780
It's funny.

618
01:00:22,174 --> 01:00:23,794
When I was a little boy

619
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:26,927
and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,

620
01:00:27,315 --> 01:00:29,067
everyone laughed at me.

621
01:00:29,504 --> 01:00:31,462
Well, no one's laughing now.

622
01:00:35,854 --> 01:00:37,452
You can say that again, pal.

623
01:00:43,533 --> 01:00:44,483
Alright,

624
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:46,516
- We've got a great show for you tonight.
- Sure.

625
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:49,683
--here actress Joan Mulligan,

626
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:53,624
and new music from
Melruban and the stiff.

627
01:00:59,234 --> 01:01:01,848
As tensions mount
around the metro area

628
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:05,453
mayor Stokes has pleaded for
cooler heads to prevail.

629
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:07,646
City services has
been affected

630
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:12,353
and some businesses have decided
to remain closed amid the unrest.

631
01:01:12,379 --> 01:01:15,145
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

632
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:18,054
The anger and resentment that's
been building in the city for weeks

633
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,887
seem close to exploding.

634
01:01:19,912 --> 01:01:23,169
Protesters, many dressed as
clowns, took the streets today

635
01:01:23,257 --> 01:01:26,712
in one of the several demonstrations
taking on the city's elite,

636
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:30,658
including a massive rally
outside the Wayne home.

637
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,715
What's the point of all this?

638
01:01:33,808 --> 01:01:35,776
Fuck the rich!
Fuck Mr. Wayne.

639
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:37,319
That's what this all fucking thing was
about.

640
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:39,501
Fuck all this system!

641
01:01:39,603 --> 01:01:43,533
Wayne, who recently announced his running
for mayor will be attending the benefit.

642
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:46,873
You might remember, it was
Thomas Wayne who first referred to

643
01:01:46,899 --> 01:01:49,924
many of Gotam's
residents as "clowns".

644
01:01:50,205 --> 01:01:52,974
Today, he offered little
in way of an apology.

645
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,253
Well, what I will say is, there's
something wrong with those people.

646
01:01:56,278 --> 01:01:58,692
And I'm here to help them.
I'm gonna lift them out of poverty,

647
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:01,211
help make they're lives better.
That's why I'm running.

648
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:04,284
They may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.

649
01:02:19,889 --> 01:02:22,249
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

650
01:02:22,274 --> 01:02:25,713
- Down with Wayne!
- Down with Wayne!

651
01:02:58,543 --> 01:03:00,160
- Down with Wayne!
- Down with Wayne!

652
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:08,324
Can I help you, pal?

653
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:11,684
I don't know what to say.

654
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:16,761
Do you want an autograph
or something?

655
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,182
No.

656
01:05:24,686 --> 01:05:26,354
My name is Arthur.

657
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,614
Penny Fleck is my mother.

658
01:05:30,825 --> 01:05:32,035
Jesus.

659
01:05:32,876 --> 01:05:34,556
You're the guy that came
to my house yesterday?

660
01:05:36,023 --> 01:05:37,423
Yes.

661
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,647
I'm sorry I just showed up.

662
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:41,574
Well, my mother
told me everything.

663
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:43,289
And I had to talk to you,

664
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,176
- you know?
- Look, pal, I'm not your father.

665
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:47,196
I mean, what's
wrong with you?

666
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,424
Look at us.

667
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:55,395
- I think you are.
- Well, that's impossible.

668
01:05:55,775 --> 01:05:58,134
Because you were adopted and
I never slept with your mother.

669
01:05:58,159 --> 01:05:59,812
What do you want
from me, money?

670
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:00,922
No. I don't want.

671
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:03,683
- I wasn't adopted.
- Jesus. She never told you?

672
01:06:04,535 --> 01:06:06,159
Told me what?

673
01:06:07,185 --> 01:06:09,203
Your mother adopted you while
she was working for us.

674
01:06:09,227 --> 01:06:11,539
That's not true.
Why are you saying that?

675
01:06:11,549 --> 01:06:14,143
Because she was arrested and
committed to Arkham State Hospital

676
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:15,617
..when you were just a little boy.

677
01:06:15,676 --> 01:06:17,035
Why are you saying this?

678
01:06:17,193 --> 01:06:20,442
I don't need you to tell me lies.
I know it seems strange.

679
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,020
I don't mean to make
you uncomfortable.

680
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:23,981
I don't why everyone is so rude,

681
01:06:24,005 --> 01:06:26,714
and I don't why you are,
I don't want anything from you.

682
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:29,240
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug dad!

683
01:06:29,265 --> 01:06:31,138
How much as a little bit
of fucking decency?

684
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:32,626
What is it with you people?!

685
01:06:32,795 --> 01:06:34,832
Did you see the way
suffer my mother?

686
01:06:34,985 --> 01:06:37,124
- She's crazy.
- She's-- huh-huh!

687
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:48,239
- You think this is funny?
- Yeah---huh-huh!

688
01:06:48,752 --> 01:06:50,661
Dad, it's me!

689
01:06:50,857 --> 01:06:51,912
Come on---huh--huh!

690
01:06:54,589 --> 01:06:57,054
You touch my son again,
I'll fucking kill you!

691
01:07:18,055 --> 01:07:20,854
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is detective Garrity.

692
01:07:20,879 --> 01:07:23,176
We met the other night
at the Gotham General.

693
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:25,772
My partner and I had
a few more questions for you.

694
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:28,826
We stopped by your apartment today,
but you weren't at home.

695
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:31,080
Please, give me a call when
you've heard this message.

696
01:07:31,105 --> 01:07:32,987
Again, this is detective Garrity.

697
01:07:33,012 --> 01:07:37,038
My number is 212---99.

698
01:08:19,318 --> 01:08:21,511
Uh, this message is
for Arthur Fleck.

699
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:25,375
My name is Shirley Woods,
I work on the Murray Franklin show.

700
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,774
I don't know
if you're aware,

701
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,715
but Murray played a clip of your
stand-up on the show recently

702
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,788
and we've gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

703
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:35,370
And Mr. Murray asked me to
give you a call and see if you're---

704
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:40,626
Who is this?

705
01:08:41,176 --> 01:08:43,084
Oh. Hi, this is Shirley Woods.

706
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:45,828
I'm the show-booker from
Live With Murray Franklin.

707
01:08:45,853 --> 01:08:47,567
Is this Arthur?

708
01:08:48,954 --> 01:08:49,963
Yes.

709
01:08:50,081 --> 01:08:52,006
Hi, Arthur.
Well, and as I was saying,

710
01:08:52,031 --> 01:08:55,738
we've gotten a lot of calls about
your clip, amazing responses.

711
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,241
And, Murray asked if I
would reach out to you

712
01:08:58,266 --> 01:09:00,167
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

713
01:09:05,463 --> 01:09:08,137
Murray wants me to come
on the Murray Franklin show?

714
01:09:08,718 --> 01:09:10,262
Yeah. Isn't that great?

715
01:09:10,287 --> 01:09:12,929
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act.

716
01:09:14,212 --> 01:09:15,807
Does that sound good to you?

717
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:22,119
Yeah, that's sounds great.

718
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:24,785
Can we set up
a date right now?

719
01:09:24,884 --> 01:09:26,593
Are you available next Thursday?

720
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:21,070
Hey.

721
01:10:21,703 --> 01:10:23,057
Wooh. Man.

722
01:10:23,091 --> 01:10:24,579
Sorry about that, my man.

723
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:27,222
All our records that are 10 years
or older are stored in the basement

724
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:30,340
and you're talking about
something' 30 years ago, so.

725
01:10:31,468 --> 01:10:33,557
Can I ask you a question?

726
01:10:33,718 --> 01:10:34,727
Sure.

727
01:10:35,462 --> 01:10:38,841
How does someone
wind up in here?

728
01:10:40,343 --> 01:10:41,511
Have they all---

729
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,817
all the people committed crimes?

730
01:10:44,544 --> 01:10:47,097
Oh, yeah. Some have.

731
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:51,262
Some are just crazy and pose a
danger to themselves or others.

732
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:53,416
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

733
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:55,512
Don't know what to do, you know?

734
01:10:55,681 --> 01:10:58,675
- Yeah, I hear you, brother.

735
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:01,982
Sometimes, I don't
know what to do.

736
01:11:03,924 --> 01:11:06,802
Last time I ended up taking
it out on some people.

737
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:11,212
I thought it was gonna bother me
but, it really hasn't.

738
01:11:13,128 --> 01:11:14,137
What's that?

739
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,543
I fucked up.

740
01:11:17,184 --> 01:11:19,784
I've done some bad shit.

741
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:21,502
Um...

742
01:11:21,948 --> 01:11:23,774
You know what
I'm talking about.

743
01:11:23,834 --> 01:11:26,125
It’s so hard just to try and be

744
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:29,603
happy all the time.

745
01:11:30,984 --> 01:11:33,192
Hey, um, listen, man...

746
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,458
I'm just an
administrative assistant.

747
01:11:35,483 --> 01:11:38,232
Like a clerk, you know.
All I do is file paperwork,

748
01:11:39,548 --> 01:11:41,075
I don't know what to tell you,

749
01:11:41,501 --> 01:11:42,831
but you should see somebody.

750
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:45,637
They have programs,

751
01:11:45,794 --> 01:11:47,230
city services, stuff like that.

752
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:49,521
Oh, yeah.

753
01:11:49,728 --> 01:11:51,417
They cut all those.

754
01:11:56,303 --> 01:11:57,884
All right.
Here it is.

755
01:11:57,969 --> 01:12:00,934
Fleck. Penny Fleck. I see.

756
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:04,909
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner...

757
01:12:06,233 --> 01:12:07,843
Oh, the patient suffers from

758
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:10,392
delusional psychosis

759
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:13,819
and narcissistic
personality disorder...hm.

760
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,692
Was found guilty of
endangering the welfare

761
01:12:16,717 --> 01:12:19,639
of her own child--

762
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:28,761
What?

763
01:12:32,062 --> 01:12:33,643
You said she's your mother?

764
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:43,424
I'm sorry,man. Like I said, I can't
release these records, you know,

765
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:46,936
without the proper forms.
I--I could get in trouble.

766
01:12:48,126 --> 01:12:51,079
Look, if you wanna bring your mom in
here to sign, that would be much easier,

767
01:12:51,104 --> 01:12:53,692
but, I can't-- I can't let this go
without a signature, okay?

768
01:12:54,349 --> 01:12:55,835
I'm sorry.

769
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:00,602
No, man!

770
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:04,404
Come on, man! Give it to me!

771
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,061
Hey! Hey!

772
01:14:06,605 --> 01:14:08,760
We went over this, Penny.

773
01:14:08,904 --> 01:14:10,320
You adopted him.

774
01:14:10,484 --> 01:14:12,320
We have all the
paperwork right here.

775
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,193
That's not true.

776
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:17,707
Thomas had them
all made up,

777
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,955
so it stayed our secret.

778
01:14:22,132 --> 01:14:24,001
You also stood by

779
01:14:25,149 --> 01:14:27,730
as one of your boyfriends
repeatedly abused

780
01:14:28,518 --> 01:14:30,256
your adopted son

781
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:32,945
and battered you.

782
01:14:51,891 --> 01:14:53,274
Penny,

783
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:57,169
your son was found
tied to a radiator

784
01:14:58,101 --> 01:14:59,727
in your filthy apartment,

785
01:15:00,469 --> 01:15:03,094
malnourished, with multiple
bruises across his body

786
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:05,213
and severe trauma to his head.

787
01:15:06,832 --> 01:15:08,905
I never heard him crying.

788
01:15:09,857 --> 01:15:12,873
He's always been such
a happy little boy.

789
01:17:14,024 --> 01:17:16,164
Shh...it's time for bed.

790
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:20,957
Oh, my god!

791
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:22,935
What are you doing in here?

792
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:27,229
You're in the wrong apartment.

793
01:17:33,954 --> 01:17:35,458
Your name is Arthur, right?

794
01:17:36,212 --> 01:17:37,676
You live down the hall.

795
01:17:40,617 --> 01:17:42,427
I really need you to leave.

796
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,866
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

797
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:55,835
Please.

798
01:17:58,396 --> 01:18:00,228
I've had a bad day.

799
01:18:03,098 --> 01:18:05,301
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

800
01:19:53,968 --> 01:19:55,300
Hi, Penny.

801
01:19:57,632 --> 01:19:59,344
Penny Fleck.

802
01:20:07,047 --> 01:20:08,862
I always hated that name.

803
01:20:12,298 --> 01:20:13,903
You know, you used to tell me

804
01:20:16,318 --> 01:20:17,686
that my laugh

805
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:19,193
was a condition,

806
01:20:20,464 --> 01:20:22,503
that there are
something wrong with me.

807
01:20:25,526 --> 01:20:26,980
There isn't.

808
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:30,767
That’s the real me.

809
01:20:31,533 --> 01:20:33,431
Ha--appy

810
01:20:35,218 --> 01:20:36,227
"Happy".

811
01:20:36,845 --> 01:20:38,292
Funny.

812
01:20:40,983 --> 01:20:42,530
I haven't been happy

813
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:45,993
for one minute of my
entire fucking life.

814
01:20:52,733 --> 01:20:54,503
You know what's funny?

815
01:20:56,972 --> 01:20:58,861
You know what really
makes me laugh?

816
01:21:00,914 --> 01:21:03,690
I used to think that
my life was a tragedy,

817
01:21:04,964 --> 01:21:06,946
but now I realize

818
01:21:06,956 --> 01:21:08,603
that's a fucking comedy.

819
01:22:20,642 --> 01:22:22,136
A very fine actor.

820
01:22:22,161 --> 01:22:24,770
He's got a new movie
called 'American Playboy',

821
01:22:24,943 --> 01:22:28,319
opening this week across the country.
Will you please welcome

822
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:31,044
a good friend of the
show, Mr. Ethan Chase.

823
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:52,728
Good to see you, Ethan.
You looking great.

824
01:22:52,753 --> 01:22:54,277
Thank you very much.
You look good yourself.

825
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,311
Ah, can't complain.

826
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:58,124
Hi, Murray,
Thank so much for having---

827
01:22:59,556 --> 01:23:00,564
Hey, Murray.

828
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:02,722
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

829
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:05,164
It's been a lifetime
dream of mine.

830
01:23:07,527 --> 01:23:08,856
I'm nervous right now.

831
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,028
- What?
- I am.

832
01:23:12,622 --> 01:23:14,266
Hey, Murray.
I've been a ---

833
01:23:14,694 --> 01:23:15,703
That's---

834
01:23:28,235 --> 01:23:29,896
I'm sorry, what's that?

835
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,692
Oh, that's really funny, Murray.

836
01:23:33,902 --> 01:23:35,889
You know, I'm also a comedian.

837
01:23:36,162 --> 01:23:37,752
Would you like to hear a joke?

838
01:23:38,571 --> 01:23:40,601
Yeah?
All of you?

839
01:23:41,738 --> 01:23:43,121
Okay.

840
01:23:45,428 --> 01:23:47,718
Knock.
Knock- knock.

841
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:02,677

01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:05,041
♪ I'd jump right on ♪
♪ a big bird and then I'd fly ♪

868
01:26:12,425 --> 01:26:13,738
Hey, Arthur.

869
01:26:14,097 --> 01:26:15,348
How's it going?

870
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,137
Oh, hi, guys.

871
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:19,062
Come on in.

872
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:21,356
Did you, uh,
get a new gig?

873
01:26:21,434 --> 01:26:22,443
No.

874
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:25,734
Oh, you must be going down
to that rally at City Hall.

875
01:26:26,096 --> 01:26:27,949
I hear It's gonna be nuts.

876
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,527
Is it today?

877
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:31,436
Yeah.

878
01:26:32,309 --> 01:26:33,844
What's with the make-up, then?

879
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:36,670
My mom died.

880
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:37,997
I'm celebrating.

881
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:41,940
Right. Uh.. we heard. That's--
That's why we came by. Figured...

882
01:26:42,214 --> 01:26:44,203
uh, you could use
some cheering up.

883
01:26:44,213 --> 01:26:45,561
Oh, that's sweet.

884
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:47,562
But, no.

885
01:26:47,731 --> 01:26:49,091
I feel good.

886
01:26:49,448 --> 01:26:51,100
I stopped taking
my medication.

887
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:52,977
I feel lot better now.

888
01:26:54,939 --> 01:26:56,304
Oh, okay.

889
01:26:56,471 --> 01:26:57,661
Well, good for you.

890
01:27:00,701 --> 01:27:03,733
So, hey, listen. Uh, I don't
know if you're heard, but..

891
01:27:03,824 --> 01:27:06,472
the cops had been calling
around the shop

892
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:08,777
talking all the guys about

893
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:11,462
those subway murders.

894
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:13,079
They didn't talk to me.

895
01:27:14,161 --> 01:27:16,778
That's because the suspect
was a regular sized person.

896
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:19,452
If it was a fucking midget
you'd be in jail right now.

897
01:27:25,348 --> 01:27:26,945
Anyway, um...

898
01:27:27,233 --> 01:27:28,927
Hoyt said that, um...

899
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:30,794
they talked to you and

900
01:27:30,978 --> 01:27:32,335
now they're looking for me---

901
01:27:32,441 --> 01:27:33,917
I just want to know
what you said.

902
01:27:33,976 --> 01:27:35,672
Make sure our stories line up,

903
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:37,290
- seeing as, um--
- Yeah.

904
01:27:37,315 --> 01:27:38,825
- you're my boy and, uh
- Yeah,

905
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,379
- it makes lot of sense,
- you know what I mean?

906
01:27:40,404 --> 01:27:42,019
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

907
01:27:42,044 --> 01:27:43,692
- I just wanna--
- Oh ,fuck!

908
01:27:48,901 --> 01:27:50,102
Oh, god!

909
01:27:50,675 --> 01:27:51,720
No!

910
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:54,630
What?

911
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:56,976
No!

912
01:28:04,524 --> 01:28:06,395
Why would you do that?

913
01:28:26,828 --> 01:28:28,602
Do you watch Murray
Franklin show?

914
01:28:29,111 --> 01:28:30,120
Yeah.

915
01:28:31,771 --> 01:28:33,045
I'll be on it tonight.

916
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:39,507
It's fucking crazy 'innit?

917
01:28:39,755 --> 01:28:41,108
Me on a telly.

918
01:28:43,427 --> 01:28:45,052
What the fuck, Arthur?

919
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:46,578
What?

920
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:47,838
What?

921
01:28:53,903 --> 01:28:55,294
It's okay, Garry.

922
01:28:55,553 --> 01:28:56,995
You can go.

923
01:28:59,143 --> 01:29:00,547
I'm not gonna hurt you.

924
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:07,658
Don't look.
Just go.

925
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,981
Oh, fuck.

926
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:28,179
- H- Hey Arthur?
- Yeah?

927
01:29:29,592 --> 01:29:31,866
Arthur, can you get.....the lock?

928
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:33,477
Oh!

929
01:29:34,921 --> 01:29:35,930
Shit.

930
01:29:36,432 --> 01:29:37,885
It's alright, Garry.

931
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:50,168
- Garry?
- Yeah?

932
01:29:53,181 --> 01:29:55,251
You’re the only one that’s
ever been nice to me.

933
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,743
Get out of here.

934
01:31:27,276 --> 01:31:29,888
Hey, Arthur!
We need to talk!

935
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:33,914
Hey, stop, Arthur!

936
01:31:38,857 --> 01:31:39,869
Arthur!

937
01:31:42,352 --> 01:31:44,094
- You fucking---
- Hey, out of the way!

938
01:31:47,052 --> 01:31:48,305
Move!

939
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:51,863
Arthur!

940
01:31:55,619 --> 01:31:57,163
- Hey!
- Hey!

941
01:32:03,428 --> 01:32:04,894
Arthur, stop!

942
01:32:09,815 --> 01:32:11,093
Go! Go!

943
01:32:17,852 --> 01:32:19,918
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

944
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:27,977
Hold that train!

945
01:32:29,185 --> 01:32:30,252
Hold that train!

946
01:32:30,735 --> 01:32:31,735
Hold it!

947
01:32:31,753 --> 01:32:33,077
Open the fucking door!

948
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,223
Get out! Get out!

949
01:32:36,077 --> 01:32:37,907
Next stop,--

950
01:32:51,536 --> 01:32:54,238
- Hey, asshole!
- Better watch it!

951
01:32:55,081 --> 01:32:56,958
Stand down! Now!

952
01:33:05,427 --> 01:33:07,514
Police!
Stand down!

953
01:33:08,146 --> 01:33:09,973
Stand down!

954
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:15,248
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh!

955
01:33:25,821 --> 01:33:28,594
Stop fighting!
Police! Police!

956
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,142
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

957
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:38,218
Police, get down!
Get the fuck down!

958
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,342
What the--?

959
01:33:54,047 --> 01:33:55,283
Arthur!

960
01:33:56,092 --> 01:33:57,499
Hey!

961
01:33:58,451 --> 01:34:00,090
God, no!

962
01:34:49,658 --> 01:34:53,263
Two officer on the train were violently
confronted by the crowd tonight

963
01:34:53,302 --> 01:34:56,408
and they're in serious but stable
condition at Gotham Metropolitan.

964
01:34:56,959 --> 01:34:59,567
We're going live now to
co-anchor Courtney Weathers

965
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:01,682
who's standing by outside
the Bedford park station

966
01:35:01,707 --> 01:35:03,601
near where the
shooting took place.

967
01:35:03,826 --> 01:35:05,649
Courtney, what's
the scene there?

968
01:35:10,969 --> 01:35:12,474
- Murray!
- Hey, hey, hey!

969
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,852
- It's "Mr. Franklin!".
- Oh, come on, Gene.

970
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:16,275
That's all bullshit.

971
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:18,821
Thank you, Murray.

972
01:35:19,494 --> 01:35:21,048
I feel like I know you.

973
01:35:21,738 --> 01:35:23,410
I've been watching
you forever.

974
01:35:23,935 --> 01:35:24,944
Thank you.

975
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:26,469
What's with the face?

976
01:35:26,562 --> 01:35:28,094
That mean that you we're
part of the protest?

977
01:35:28,119 --> 01:35:29,707
No. No.

978
01:35:29,777 --> 01:35:31,766
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

979
01:35:32,192 --> 01:35:33,693
I don't believe in anything.

980
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:35,920
I just thought it would
be good for my act.

981
01:35:35,974 --> 01:35:38,305
For your act? Didn't you hear
what happened on the subway?

982
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,623
- Some clown got killed.
- He's aware of that, yeah.

983
01:35:40,725 --> 01:35:42,328
No, I haven't heard.

984
01:35:42,543 --> 01:35:44,111
- Yeah?
- You see ,this is what I’m telling you.

985
01:35:44,136 --> 01:35:46,222
the audience is gonna go
crazy if you put this guy on.

986
01:35:46,247 --> 01:35:48,475
Maybe-- maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

987
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,574
Gene, It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

988
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:53,426
We're gonna go with it.

989
01:35:54,038 --> 01:35:55,047
Thank you, Murray.

990
01:35:55,169 --> 01:35:56,326
Couple of rules though:

991
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:58,373
No cursing,
no off-color material,

992
01:35:58,398 --> 01:36:01,369
- we do a clean show, okay?

993
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,458
You go on right after Dr. Sally.

994
01:36:03,586 --> 01:36:05,549
- I love Dr. Sally.
- Good! Good, good.

995
01:36:05,574 --> 01:36:07,432
- Well, someone will come
and get you, okay? - Okay.

996
01:36:08,071 --> 01:36:09,111
Perfect.

997
01:36:09,212 --> 01:36:10,367
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Murray.

998
01:36:10,391 --> 01:36:11,404
Okay.

999
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:14,038
Hey, Murray...
one small thing.

1000
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,423
- Yeah?
- When you bring me out

1001
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:18,714
can you introduce
me as "Joker"?

1002
01:36:19,155 --> 01:36:20,835
What's wrong with
your real name?

1003
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:23,445
That's what you
called me on the show.

1004
01:36:23,676 --> 01:36:25,144
A Joker.

1005
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,209
Do you remember?

1006
01:36:26,445 --> 01:36:28,157
- Did I?
- Yeah, I don't know.

1007
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:30,793
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, joker it is.

1008
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:33,016
- It's good.
- Thanks, Murray.

1009
01:36:54,846 --> 01:36:57,821
I would try it, you know, but I'm not
sure my wife would let me do it.

1010
01:37:00,143 --> 01:37:01,911
Maybe my next wife.

1011
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,043
You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.

1012
01:37:07,068 --> 01:37:09,183
I'm pretty sure this
guy can use a doctor.

1013
01:37:09,807 --> 01:37:11,957
Oh, does he have
a sexual problem?

1014
01:37:11,982 --> 01:37:14,254
He looks like he's got
a lot of problems.

1015
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:18,183
Alright, Let's show
that clip one last time.

1016
01:37:24,813 --> 01:37:28,676
I hated school as a kid.

1017
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:31,571
But my mother
would always say,

1018
01:37:32,468 --> 01:37:33,954
"You should enjoy it.

1019
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:37,102
One day you'll have
to work for a living."

1020
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:40,631
"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"

1021
01:37:46,356 --> 01:37:47,357
Okay,

1022
01:37:50,008 --> 01:37:53,265
you may have seen that
clip of our next guest.

1023
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:55,770
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

1024
01:37:55,795 --> 01:37:59,394
that we're all heartbroken about
what's going on in the city tonight.

1025
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:02,194
But, this is how he
wanted to come out.

1026
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:05,457
And, honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

1027
01:38:05,482 --> 01:38:07,790
So, please welcome "Joker".

1028
01:38:49,988 --> 01:38:52,167
Are you alright, doctor?

1029
01:38:54,844 --> 01:38:56,852
Well, that was...
quite an interest.

1030
01:39:05,317 --> 01:39:06,470
You okay?

1031
01:39:08,505 --> 01:39:09,960
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:39:10,186 --> 01:39:12,822
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1033
01:39:14,845 --> 01:39:16,576
Well, that makes one of us.

1034
01:39:23,513 --> 01:39:25,666
So, can you tell
us about this look?

1035
01:39:26,062 --> 01:39:27,632
When we spoke earlier,
you mentioned

1036
01:39:27,657 --> 01:39:30,167
that this look is not a political
statement, is that right?

1037
01:39:30,496 --> 01:39:32,207
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1038
01:39:32,545 --> 01:39:34,537
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1039
01:39:35,196 --> 01:39:36,808
And how's that
goin' for ya?

1040
01:39:43,914 --> 01:39:46,544
It's alright. It's alright.
So, I know you're a comedian.

1041
01:39:46,956 --> 01:39:48,868
Have you been working
on any new material?

1042
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,175
You want to tell us a joke?

1043
01:39:55,464 --> 01:39:56,656
Yeah?

1044
01:39:58,741 --> 01:39:59,977
Okay.

1045
01:40:05,747 --> 01:40:07,491
He's got a book.

1046
01:40:08,275 --> 01:40:09,989
A book of jokes.

1047
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,132
Take your time.
We go all night.

1048
01:40:26,828 --> 01:40:29,228
Okay. Okay.
Here's one.

1049
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,818
Knock-knock.

1050
01:40:36,043 --> 01:40:37,632
And you had to look that up?

1051
01:40:43,899 --> 01:40:45,321
I wanted to get it right.

1052
01:40:47,544 --> 01:40:49,005
Knock-knock.

1053
01:40:49,295 --> 01:40:50,928
Who's there?

1054
01:40:52,165 --> 01:40:53,706
It's the Police, ma'am.

1055
01:40:53,721 --> 01:40:55,660
Your son has been hit
by a drunk driver.

1056
01:40:55,747 --> 01:40:57,178
He's dead.

1057
01:40:59,684 --> 01:41:01,497
Oh, no, no, no!

1058
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:03,561
No, you cannot
joke about that.

1059
01:41:03,586 --> 01:41:05,640
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1060
01:41:05,665 --> 01:41:07,979
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

1061
01:41:08,632 --> 01:41:10,821
Okay, I'm s--
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1062
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:12,534
It's just, you know,

1063
01:41:13,081 --> 01:41:16,123
it's been a rough
few weeks, Murray,

1064
01:41:17,007 --> 01:41:18,574
ever since I

1065
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:23,724
killed those three wall-street guys.

1066
01:41:30,162 --> 01:41:31,927
Okay. I'm waiting
for the punchline.

1067
01:41:33,579 --> 01:41:35,140
There is no punchline.

1068
01:41:36,663 --> 01:41:38,519
It's not a joke.

1069
01:41:43,999 --> 01:41:45,171
You're serious, aren't you?

1070
01:41:45,203 --> 01:41:47,565
You're telling us you killed those
three young men on the subway?

1071
01:41:47,627 --> 01:41:50,463
- M-hm.
- And why should we believe you?

1072
01:41:50,739 --> 01:41:52,391
I've got nothing left to lose.

1073
01:41:54,696 --> 01:41:56,334
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1074
01:41:59,842 --> 01:42:02,579
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1075
01:42:05,977 --> 01:42:09,428
Let me get this straight, you think
that killing those guys is funny?

1076
01:42:10,161 --> 01:42:11,467
I do.

1077
01:42:11,827 --> 01:42:14,113
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

1078
01:42:14,633 --> 01:42:16,694
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1079
01:42:16,995 --> 01:42:18,374
Isn't that what they say?

1080
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:20,299
All of you,

1081
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:23,103
the system that
knows so much,

1082
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:26,508
you decide what's
right or wrong

1083
01:42:26,533 --> 01:42:30,557
the same way that you
decide what's funny...

1084
01:42:30,779 --> 01:42:32,195
or not.

1085
01:42:32,552 --> 01:42:33,957
Get him off!

1086
01:42:34,139 --> 01:42:35,588
Well, okay, I--I think

1087
01:42:35,875 --> 01:42:37,972
I might understand that you

1088
01:42:38,368 --> 01:42:39,893
did this to start a movement,

1089
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:42,030
to become a symbol.

1090
01:42:42,528 --> 01:42:44,181
Come on, Murray,

1091
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:46,590
do I look like the kind of a clown
that could start a movement?

1092
01:42:47,306 --> 01:42:49,593
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1093
01:42:50,474 --> 01:42:52,967
Everybody's awful these days.

1094
01:42:53,085 --> 01:42:55,004
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1095
01:42:55,177 --> 01:42:57,869
Okay. So that's it, you're crazy.
That's your defense

1096
01:42:57,894 --> 01:42:59,462
for killing three
young men?

1097
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,105
Nah.

1098
01:43:01,777 --> 01:43:05,046
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

1099
01:43:06,894 --> 01:43:10,050
Oh! Why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

1100
01:43:10,883 --> 01:43:14,379
If it was me dying on the side-walk,
you'd walk right over me.

1101
01:43:14,426 --> 01:43:17,535
I pass you everyday and you
don't notice me! but these guys,

1102
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:20,729
what, because Thomas Wayne
went and cried about them on TV?

1103
01:43:20,771 --> 01:43:23,599
Well, you have a problem
with Thomas Wayne,too?

1104
01:43:23,609 --> 01:43:25,228
Yes, I do.

1105
01:43:25,978 --> 01:43:29,106
Have you seen what
it's like out there, Murray?

1106
01:43:29,434 --> 01:43:31,726
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1107
01:43:32,868 --> 01:43:36,417
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

1108
01:43:36,566 --> 01:43:38,520
Nobody's civil anymore!

1109
01:43:38,858 --> 01:43:42,182
Nobody thinks what
it's like to be the other guy.

1110
01:43:43,131 --> 01:43:45,015
You think men like Thomas Wayne

1111
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:47,798
ever think what it's like
to be someone like me?

1112
01:43:48,066 --> 01:43:50,606
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1113
01:43:50,952 --> 01:43:53,923
They think that we'll just
sit there and take it

1114
01:43:54,041 --> 01:43:55,577
like good little boys!

1115
01:43:55,639 --> 01:43:57,962
That we won't
werewolf and go wild.

1116
01:43:58,141 --> 01:43:59,356
You finished?

1117
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:01,965
I mean, there is so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1118
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:05,229
You sound like you're making
excuses for killing those young men.

1119
01:44:05,431 --> 01:44:08,604
Not everybody- and I'll tell you this-
not everyone is awful.

1120
01:44:10,721 --> 01:44:13,076
- But you're awful, Murray.
- Me?

1121
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,624
I'm awful? Oh, yeah?
How am I awful?

1122
01:44:18,144 --> 01:44:19,611
Playing my video,

1123
01:44:20,928 --> 01:44:22,544
inviting me on the show---

1124
01:44:23,993 --> 01:44:26,315
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1125
01:44:27,371 --> 01:44:29,311
You're just like the rest of 'em.

1126
01:44:29,427 --> 01:44:31,523
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

1127
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:34,122
Look what happened because
of what you did, what it led to.

1128
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:35,916
There are riots out there.

1129
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:38,777
Two policemen are in critical
condition and you're laughing.

1130
01:44:38,802 --> 01:44:41,212
You're laughing.
Someone was killed today

1131
01:44:42,271 --> 01:44:43,787
because of what you did.

1132
01:44:43,812 --> 01:44:45,084
I know.

1133
01:44:47,845 --> 01:44:49,304
How about a another joke, Murray?

1134
01:44:49,329 --> 01:44:50,989
No, I think we got
enough of your jokes.

1135
01:44:51,014 --> 01:44:52,577
- What do you get..
- I don't think so.

1136
01:44:52,602 --> 01:44:56,113
..when you cross a mentally-ill
loner with a society

1137
01:44:56,138 --> 01:44:58,486
that abandons him and
treats him like trash?

1138
01:44:58,511 --> 01:44:59,664
Call the police, Gene.

1139
01:44:59,689 --> 01:45:01,058
- I'll tell you what you get.
- Call the police!

1140
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:02,825
You get what you
fucking deserve!

1141
01:45:38,935 --> 01:45:41,559
Good night.
And always remember.

1142
01:45:41,939 --> 01:45:44,031
That's--

1143
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:48,901
Breaking news.

1144
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,669
Popular TV talk show host
Murray Franklin was

1145
01:45:51,694 --> 01:45:55,021
shot dead tonight on the live telecast
of his program by one of his guests.

1146
01:45:55,046 --> 01:45:59,235
--the man who was introduced by Franklin
as "Joker" is currently under arrest--

1147
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:02,758
-- The police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio--

1148
01:46:02,783 --> 01:46:06,432
- ...when asking him what he did..
- ...merely just a punchline to a joke...

1149
01:46:06,457 --> 01:46:08,652
- Would you like another joke?
- I don't think so.

1150
01:46:12,102 --> 01:46:15,606
...with the society that abandons him
and treats him like trash.

1151
01:46:19,953 --> 01:46:23,375
If it was me dying on the side-walk,
you'd walk right over me!

1152
01:46:23,592 --> 01:46:26,009
To all of those who have been
ignored by the system--

1153
01:46:26,034 --> 01:46:28,846
--and as you can see,
Gotham is burning---

1154
01:47:23,859 --> 01:47:26,157
Stop laughing you freak.
This isn't funny.

1155
01:47:26,411 --> 01:47:29,010
We have the whole fucking city's
on fire because of what you did.

1156
01:47:30,122 --> 01:47:33,979
All units, fire reported.
North of ally.

1157
01:47:34,403 --> 01:47:36,010
I know.

1158
01:47:37,073 --> 01:47:39,116
Isn't it beautiful?

1159
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,705
Let's go over there.

1160
01:49:41,461 --> 01:49:42,752
Hey, Wayne.

1161
01:49:43,627 --> 01:49:45,467
You get what you
fucking deserve.

1162
01:49:45,492 --> 01:49:46,792
No, pal!

1163
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,394
Joker!

1164
01:50:29,419 --> 01:50:31,657
Joker!

1165
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,316
What's so funny?

1166
01:53:14,411 --> 01:53:15,963
I just think--

1167
01:53:16,694 --> 01:53:18,583
--just thinking of this joke.

1168
01:53:37,567 --> 01:53:39,039
You wanna tell it to me?

1169
01:53:45,423 --> 01:53:47,086
